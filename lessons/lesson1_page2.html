<p>The Controller is generally a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) that can be thought of as the machine&rsquo;s brain. It specifies the commands that are contained in the CAD/CAM file.&nbsp; It sends these commands to the Amplifier (or Driver) that power the positioning motors, which dictate machine movement. In closed loop systems, the Controller also receives signals from various devices such as Encoders, limit switches, and other sensors on the machine.(6)</p>
