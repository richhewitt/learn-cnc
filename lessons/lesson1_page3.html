<p>The circuitry of the Controller operates at much lower voltages than is required to power the machine motors. The Amplifier (or Driver) takes signals from the Controller and increases it to a voltage that the motor can use.&nbsp; There is one amplifier per motor. In the picture above there are five grey boxes containing one amplifier each because this is for a 5-axis CNC machine.(6)&nbsp; </p>
