<p>CNC machines move in 3D space.  It is important to have a standardized way of describing that movement.  Looking at the graphic above, there are three directions of linear movement: x, y, and z.  There are also three rotational movements about those axis: a, b, and c.</p>

<p>A 5-axis CNC machine means it has 5 axis of movement, or 5 degrees of freedom.  This means it can move about the x, y, and z-axis and two rotational axis.</p>

<p>How a machine can move often dictates what types of cutting applications it is appropriate for.  For instance, a 3-axis machine might not be suitable for machining complex curves and organic surfaces.  However, a 5-axis machine could be overkill for processing simple geometries on panels, when a 3-axis machine can do the same thing at a fraction of the cost.</p>
