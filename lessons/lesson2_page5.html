<h1>Tool Changers</h1>

<p>For simpler CNC machines, each tool can be manually installed into the spindle when it is needed.  High production machines, however, require fast turnover between different tools.  Different magazines have been developed to hold a multitude of tools for quick and automatic changeover.</p>

<p>This is likely the simplest tool changer for CNC machines. Tools are held in a row on one side of the machine. First, the main spindle head travels to the tool needed.&nbsp; It then lowers and connects onto the tool holder.&nbsp; Once the tool holder is secured, the spindle moves away taking the tool with it.&nbsp; These steps are reversed to bring the tool back to the magazine.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>Chain Tool Changer</h2>

<p>In a chain-type tool changer, tools are moved into position using a traveling chain.&nbsp; Once in position, the spindle can connect to the tool holder.&nbsp; This system has the potential to hold a large number of tools.</p>

<h2>Rotary Tool Changer</h2>

<p>A rotary toolchanger holds tools in a circular fashion, rotating the correct tool to the electrospindle.</p>

<h2>Traveling Tool Changer</h2>

<p>This type of tool changer travels with the spindle as it is machining.&nbsp; Sometimes only a few tools are needed to machine a simple part, but many tools are needed to continuously operate the machine.&nbsp; In these cases, several tools can be installed in a traveling tool changer while other, less frequently used tools are held in a chain or rotary tool changer.

This system dramatically reduces the tool changeover time and increases the machine&rsquo;s utilization. In a large plant with high throughput, the time savings can substantially add up over time. (6)&nbsp;
