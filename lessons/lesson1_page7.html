<p>CNC machinery is expensive technology and safeguards must be built into the machines to protect them from accidental damage during operation. Limits built into the machine are designed to do this. </p>

<p>There are three main types of limits and they are listed in order of operation:
</p>

<h2>Software Limits</h2>
<p>Software limits specify settings such as the maximum Z-depth and maximum feed speed. They can be set by the  programmer in the CAM file or built into the machine by its manufacturer. </p>

<h2>Limit Switches</h2>
<p>Limit switches are usually optical or magnetic. Optical limits usually employ lasers that will be triggered if the machine moves past it. When triggered, the machine is stopped by the control system. Limit switches are often used to &ldquo;Home&rdquo; the machine, or bring it back to its zero position. (3)</p>

<h2>Mechanical Limits</h2>

</div>
<p>Mechanical limits are physical contact points that prevent the machine from moving further. This is the limit of last defense and is activated only if the other two limits have failed to stop the machine. (6)</p>
