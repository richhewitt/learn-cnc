<p>A Comparator is an electrical device that compares input from the Encoder to the original commands sent from the Controller. If the electrical signals do not match up, the Comparator adjusts the electrical signal outgoing to the amplifier for any difference it reads from the Encoder to obey the Controller.&nbsp; In a system using DC motors, the Comparator would adjust voltage to compensate.&nbsp; With AC motors, the Comparator would adjust frequency.

<p>A Comparator is very useful to account for outside forces. Outside forces include such things as vibrations, friction, mechanical wear, and changing environmental conditions. These all can significantly influence the accuracy of the machine. The Comparator helps ensure that the machine is moving as intended. (6)</p>
