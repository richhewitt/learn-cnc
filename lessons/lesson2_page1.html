<h1>Electric Motor</h1>
<p>There are two types of electric motors used in CNC technology: DC and AC motors. DC motors operate on Direct Current and AC motors on Alternating Current.&nbsp; The speed of a DC motor is controlled by varying the voltage of the incoming DC electricity.&nbsp; The speed of AC motors is controlled by varying the frequency of the incoming three-phase AC electricity.&nbsp; The torque of AC motors is proportional to the applied current.

<p>Steppers motors are a very common type of AC motor used in CNC machines.&nbsp; As the name implies, these motors rotate in steps, with one step per pulse of alternating current.&nbsp; Each step in movement is very small and there can be as many as 50,000 microsteps per revolution. (13)</p>

<p>If the torque applied to the stepper is within the motor’s limits, it can be very accurate.&nbsp; However, if the torque exceeds the motors capacity, the motor can “slip” and the desired position will not be reached.&nbsp; For this reason, open loop systems can become inaccurate.&nbsp; In a closed loop system, this “slip” can be adjusted for.&nbsp; If a stepper (or any other type of motor) is used in a closed loop system they are often referred to as servomotors.
