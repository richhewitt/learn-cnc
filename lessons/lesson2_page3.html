<p>CNC routers generate a lot of dust due to the high speeds and small chips produced. Machining wood composite panel materials like Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF) results in a large amount of airborne particulates produced. It is very important that this dust is carried into the central dust extraction unit to ensure a healthy indoor air environment. Besides health benefits, a dust-free environment improves product quality, especially for later finishing stages.</p>
