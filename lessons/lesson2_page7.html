<h1>Tool Holders</h1>

<p>There are two main parts in CNC tool holders, the part that connects the spindle to the holder and the part that connects the holder to the tool. There are two major types of spindle to holder connections and four major types of holder to tool connections. Many combinations of these types exist, with the best combination being unique to the individual machine and application. (3)&nbsp; </p>
<p>The functions of the holder are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firmly connect the tool to the spindle</li>
<li>Easily engage and disengage with the spindle</li>
<li>Engage with the tool changer</li>
<li>Transfer power to the tool</li>
<li>Align the tool</li>
<li>Allow for different tools to be installed in the holder</li>
</ul>

<p>CNC equipment with automatic tool changers use tapered connections between the holder and the spindle. Tapers having a 7:24 ratio became the accepted standard around which a number of similar types were developed.&nbsp; There is the CAT standard in North America, BT in Japan, and SK in Europe as well as ISO. Because they all have long shafts they appear similar, however, they have different sizes, tolerance, and locking mechanisms. Collectively they are &ldquo;the steep-taper type&rdquo;. The shank of these tools fit into a matching tapered bore in the spindle shaft and a latching mechanism is used to pull the parts together. There were faults to the designs that were difficult to overcome because conformance was not easily controlled.&nbsp; Also, proprietary issues and patented features blocked development. (3)</p>

<h3>HSK</h3>

<p>In the 1980s and 90s the HSK design with 1:10 taper was developed and adopted by European manufacturers and is becoming the international standard.&nbsp; It is covered by DIN standards, and is free of patents.&nbsp; The main advantages are: improved accuracy, better performance at high spindle speeds, faster changes, transmits more torque, less wear, and less likely to wear out the spindle or damage it when there is a collision.&nbsp; The disadvantage is that it is more expensive to manufacture and rebuild.

<h3>Collet</h3>

<p>A collet is a sleeve with a conical outside and a straight bore inside which the straight tool shank is fitted into. When the assembly is pushed into the tapered bore of the holder, the bore of the collet shrinks and exerts great pressure on the tool. (3)</p> 
 
<p>Collets are used in a wide variety of machines, from small hand-held engraving tools to large milling machines. Collets are very common on routers for a good reason; one collet size can be obtained in a wide range of bores so when the tool shank size is changed, only the collet is changed and the other holder parts remain the same. (3)</p>
<p>While there are many collet types used on machinery, two basic types are used on CNC routers; half grip, and full grip. They differ by the way they are slotted. Half grip collets are designed for one tool diameter, whereas full grip can be used on a very limited range of shank diameters. It is important to note that the extension of the tool shank must be appropriate for the collet type. Ideally, the shank should be inserted to a depth between 75% and 80% of the collet length and the flutes should never engage with the collet. (3)</p>
<p> Collets can be easily damaged and should be cleaned and inspected prior to assembly. Collets should be thought of as wear parts. Wear usually widens the bore of the collet at the tool entrance, causing the unsupported length to increase. As the wear gets worse the rate of wear increases until an undesirable effect is noticed; either the tool vibrates, accuracy is lost, the tool breaks, the tool shank wears, or the spindle is damaged. For these reasons, collets should be replaced before they wear out. (3)</p>
<h3>Hydraulic</h3>

<p>Hydraulic type tool holders have a cavity within the bore hub into which fluid is pressurized to 20,000 to 30,000 psi (1380 to 2068 bar). A holder is shown below along with a sketch of the major components. As the threaded actuator is tightened, the pressure increases causing the inner sleeve to deform into the bore until it contacts the tool shank along its length.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will increase the contact pressure between the inner ring and the shank, thus firmly securing the tool. Unlike full grip collets, each hydraulic chuck only fits one shank size. One of the only drawbacks to hydraulic chucks is that the tool will come loose if, through neglect or incompetence, the actuator is not correctly tightened. (3)</p>

<h3>Shrink Type</h3>

<p>Shrink type tool holders are another accurate and convenient method of holding tools and, according to some, considered the most accurate. The concept is simple. Both the bore and the shanks need to be precision machined such that the bore is approximately 999/1000s of the shank diameter. That is, for a 20.000 mm shank, the bore will be 19.980 mm.&nbsp; To install the tool, the holder is heated by induction, thereby expanding the bore. The tool is inserted and the assembly is then cooled. To extract the tool from the holder, the process is reversed.&nbsp; They are a little less convenient than hydraulic chucks, however if the clearances are correct there is no danger of the tool coming out.&nbsp; The temperature is high, so cooling time is required and care must be taken to not get burned.

<h3>Tribos</h3>

<p>
There are several proprietary precision tool holders available. One of note and used on wood machining routers, is the Tribos system. The concept is quite simple; a holder very much like the shrink chuck is first roughly bored undersize. It is then deformed into a slight triangle shape and bored to the final size, slightly over the tool diameter. The bore will therefore, be round only when the forces are applied and will be triangular when released. The dimensions are such that when released, the triangular size is less than that of the tool, so the tool is gripped from three directions. (3)
