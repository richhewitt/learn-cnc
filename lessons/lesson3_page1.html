<h1>Cutting Applications in the  Wood Products Industry</h1>

<h2>Contour Routing</h2>

<p>Basic contour routing is very common in panel processing. This cut involves the tool following a contour (as viewed from above) at a specified depth through the material. The contour can be as simple as a straight line, a complex set of curves, or a combination of the two.</p>

<h2>Nesting</h2>
<p>Oftentimes a strategy known as nesting is used in panel processing. Nesting involves arranging many parts close together on a single workpiece to eliminate as much waste as possible and reduce machining time. This strategy is commonly seen in the industry because it can dramatically cut down on raw material costs by efficiently utilizing each panel. CAM software can be helpful in automatically optimizing the part layout for nesting.</p>

<h2>Drilling</h2>

<p>Drilling is another very common CNC cutting application. In fact, it was the very first application used when CNC technology was being developed in the 1950s. CNC drilling is much faster and more accurate than hand drilling. Also, if the spacing between drill holes is consistent (such as the 32mm standard), banks of drills can be employed to machine several holes in unison. This approach can greatly decrease processing time.</p>

<h2>Sawing</h2>

<p>Sawing is a less typical cutting application for CNC Routers, as this job is usually left to CNC panel saws or a standard table saw. It performs the same end-goal as a straight cut in perimeter routing, but generally at higher feed speeds.  This application can be used to size panels and cut groves into the edge. It is important to note that many sawing strategies require more than 3-axis of movement to orient the blade perpendicular to the material surface. To overcome this, 3-axis machines can be equipped with aggregates that allow for more freedom of movement.</p>

<h2>Profiling</h2>

<p>Profiling involves cutting a profile into the edge of the material. The profile range from a simple bevel to a complex, custom designed profile. Profiled bits can be bought from a tool manufacturer or knives can be custom cut in-house and then inserted into the tool body. CNC profiling is commonly seen in the window frame, door, and molding industry.</p>

<h2>3D Machining</h2>

<p>3D machining is used to cut complex surfaces and can require thousands of lines of machine code. As such, it is necessary to use advanced CAD/CAM software.</p>
<p>While 3-axis machines can be used to cut 3D surfaces, the process is slow and the surface shapes are restricted.&nbsp; Likewise, 5-axis machines are usually employed when high production rates are required.</p>
<h2>Engraving</h2>

<p>CNC engraving is often used to personalize a product.&nbsp; A V-groove bit can be used to cut text (such as someoneâ€™s name or a company name) into the workpiece surface. When used in combination with a beveled router bit, it can produce very elegant text-effects.</p>
