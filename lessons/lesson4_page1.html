<h1>Velocities of Tool Cutting</h1>

<ol>
<li><em>Rim Speed</em>: the velocity of the cutting edge of the tool due to its rotation</li>
<li><em>Feed Speed</em>: the velocity of the tool as it moves through the workpiece</li>
<li><em>True Speed</em>: the resultant velocity of rim speed and feed speed combined</li>
</ol>

<p>Rim speed increases with both the rotational speed (rpm) of the spindle and the diameter of the tool bit.  Feed speed depends on the motor speeds of the x and y-axis. (3)</p>
