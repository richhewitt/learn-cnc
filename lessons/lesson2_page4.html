<h1>Work Tables</h1>

<p>There are four main types of work tables on CNC routers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flat Table</li>
<li>Multi-Function Table</li>
<li>Rail and Pod System</li>
<li>Clamps and Jigs</li>
</ol>

<h2>Flat Tables</h2>

</div>

<p>Flat tables are simple type of machining table. The picture above shows holes in the table where a vacuum draws air to create a suction. In this system it would probably be best to use a spoilboard. A spoilboard is a panel placed between the machine table and the workpiece being machined. The machine is allowed to cut all the way through the work panel and into the spoilboard. MDF is often used as a spoil-board because it is porous and can therefore transfer the suction from a vacuum system. </p>

<h2>Multi-Function Tables</h2>

</div>

<p>Multi-Function tables are similar to flat tables, but offer expanded functionality. There are grooves machined into the table to allow rubber gaskets to be inserted. The gaskets can be arranged to accommodate a large variety of shapes and sizes. Specialized suction cups (or pods) can also be placed to elevate the workpiece off the table and eliminate the need for a spoilboard.&nbsp; Great care must be taken when placing the cups, so that the tool avoids the cups when machining.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>Rail and Pod System</h2>

<div class="caption">Console arms move for x-axis positioning, suction cups for y-axis positioning</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Rail and Pod (or Console Arm and Suction Cup) system utilizes pods to hold down the workpiece using a vacuum.&nbsp; These suction cups can be taken on and off the rails. The rails can be moved along one axis with the suction cups moving along the other axis. This system is very flexible, but as with any suction cup system, extreme care must be taken to ensure the cups are located in the right position. In fact, oftentimes the software programs included with the machine will help correctly place the rails to avoid damage.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>Clamps and Jigs</h2>

</div>

<p>Specialized clamps and jigs are often needed to securely hold oddly shaped pieces.</p>

<h2>Workpiece Positioning Systems</h2>

<p>It is extremely important to properly position the workpiece on the table, otherwise it will be improperly machined and serious machine damage or human injury could occur. Since the machine does not have the ability to determine where the workpiece is located, the operator must locate it properly. Below are a couple of devices available to assist the operator in this.&nbsp; </p>

<h3>Positioning Pins</h3>

<p>Most panel processing CNC machines are equipped with positioning pins. They help the operator locate the x=0, y=0 position.</p>  

<h3>Rail and Pod Positioning</h3>

<p>If a CNC machine has a rail and pod system, then it will also have a piece of software for properly positioning the rails and pods. This software add-on will let you preview programmed toolpaths and identify possible collisions between the tool pods. </p>

<p>There are many other positioning systems available and they will vary with manufacturer. Each one has its own benefits and drawbacks. But with all of them, it's important to keep in mind that an effective workpiece positioning system is necessary for safe and successful machining. </p>
