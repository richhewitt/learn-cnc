<p>The developers of this game would like to be clear that they are not the sole originators or owners of this information. Much of this content was based off of notes originally compiled by Jordon Barlow from PowerPoint presentations written by Robert Fuerst 
  for WOOD 492, a course in tooling given in the Wood Products Processing Program at the University of British 
  Columbia.  Later editing and additions to those notes were added by Pat Cramond.  Richard Hewitt was then responsible for using his discretion to obtain information from those notes, adding in his personal knowledge to fill in areas, and doing outside research. Contributions to the original WOOD 492 
  course were made by Dr. Darrell Wong, while at UBC, and based on a similar course by Dr. Frieder Scholtz, 
  Rosenheim University of Applied Sciences.</p>
