# Background
I was very bored in my CNC machining course.  The material was technical and 3D in nature, yet was being taught using an overhead projecter.  How archaic!  So I began daydreaming of a different, more fun way.  I wrote up a $50K grant proposal for an open source 3D learning environment on CNC machines and BCCampus accepted.

Over the next month, my fellow colleague and student, Robert Shum, and I interviewed and hired  Nik (a software engineer) and Jason (a 3D modeller and animator).  Our team of 4 UBC students built The LearnCNC project over the next 8 months in our spare time.

The content was originally embedded in a 3D gaming environment and was available for free download on Windows.  We did this way back in 2008/09 and since then the gaming engine company has gone defunct and the [MSI package](https://sourceforge.net/projects/learn-cnc-game/files/learn-cnc-game/LearnCNCGame_v1.0.0.msi) no longer works on modern Windows.  It's so old it was hosted on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/learn-cnc-game/) and even had some Flash in it.  Ahhhh the old days.

I pulled the content out, coverted old Flash Videos to YouTube, and rehosted and deployed here on Github.  Hurray!

If you find the interface super retro-looking... remember... it was 2009.  Embrace the nostalgia and enjoy :)
