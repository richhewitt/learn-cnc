# The LearnCNC Project

# Background
Way back in my university days, I sat very bored in a CNC machining course.  The material was technical and 3D in nature, but was being taught using an overhead projecter.  How archaic!  I began daydreaming of a different, more fun way.  I wrote up a $50K grant proposal for an open source 3D learning environment on CNC machines and BCCampus accepted with generous funding.

Over the next month, Robert (a fellow student and colleague) and I interviewed and hired Nik (student, software engineer) and Jason (student, 3D modeller and animator).  Our team of 4 UBC students built The LearnCNC project over the next 8 months in our spare time.

The content was originally embedded in a 3D gaming environment and was available for free download on Windows.  We did this way back in 2008/09 and since then the gaming engine company has gone defunct and the [MSI package](https://sourceforge.net/projects/learn-cnc-game/files/learn-cnc-game/LearnCNCGame_v1.0.0.msi) no longer works on modern Windows.  If you can get that to work, kudos to you.  You can find all of the source files in the original repo, hosted on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/learn-cnc-game/).  Yes, it's that old.

I've since pulled all the learning content out, coverted Flash Videos to YouTube, and rehosted and deployed here on Github.  Hurray!

If you find the interface super retro-looking and video quality low, remember, it was 2009.  Embrace the nostalgia and enjoy :)
