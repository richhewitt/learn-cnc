# Background
I was very bored in my CNC machining course.  The material is very 3D and technical, yet was being taught using an overhead projecter.  How archaic!  So I began daydreaming of a different, more fun way.  I took my idea to the Iain MacDonald, the Director of the Centre for Advanced Wood Processing at UBC.  He encouraged me to apply for a grant.  A couple months later I was rejected and deflated.  Iain encouraged me to apply again to a different organization: BCCampus.  They accepted and I was awarded with a $50K grant!

Over the next month my fellow colleague and student, Robert Shum, and I interviewed and hired a software engineer and 3D modeller and animator, also students at UBC.  Our team of 4 built The LearnCNC project over the next 8 months in our spare time.

This content was originally embedded in a 3D learning environment that was available for free download on Windows.  Keep in mind we did this way back in 2008/09.  Since then, the gaming engine company has gone defunct and the [MSI package](https://sourceforge.net/projects/learn-cnc-game/files/learn-cnc-game/LearnCNCGame_v1.0.0.msi) no longer works on modern Windows.  It's so old it was hosted on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/learn-cnc-game/) and had some Flash in it.  Ahhhh the old days.

The content is all JS/HTML/CSS, videos, and images and has now been relaunched here on Github.  Hurray!
