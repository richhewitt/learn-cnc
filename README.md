# The LearnCNC Project

# Background
I was very bored in my CNC machining course.  The material was technical and 3D in nature, yet was being taught using an overhead projecter.  How archaic!  So I began daydreaming of a different, more fun way.  I wrote up a $50K grant proposal for an open source 3D learning environment on CNC machines and BCCampus accepted with generous funding.

Over the next month, my fellow colleague and student, Robert Shum, and I interviewed and hired  Nik (a software engineer) and Jason (a 3D modeller and animator).  Our team of 4 UBC students built The LearnCNC project over the next 8 months in our spare time.

The content was originally embedded in a 3D gaming environment and was available for free download on Windows.  We did this way back in 2008/09 and since then the gaming engine company has gone defunct and the [MSI package](https://sourceforge.net/projects/learn-cnc-game/files/learn-cnc-game/LearnCNCGame_v1.0.0.msi) no longer works on modern Windows.  You can find all of the original source files in the original repo, hosted on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/learn-cnc-game/).  The project is so old, there's even some Flash in there!

I've since pulled all the learning content out, coverted Flash Videos to YouTube, and rehosted and deployed here on Github.  Hurray!

If you find the interface super retro-looking and video quality low, remember, it was 2009.  Embrace the nostalgia and enjoy :)
