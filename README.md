# The LearnCNC Project

# Background
It began with boredom.  I was sitting in my CNC machining courses, blankly staring forward.  The course material was technical and 3D in nature, yet was being taught with an overhead projector!  I began daydreaming of a different, more fun way to present the material.  Over the next few weeks, with encourgement a mentor, I wrote up a $50K grant proposal for an open source 3D learning environment on CNC machines.  1 rejection and several months later, BCCampus accepted with generous funding!

Over the next month, Robert (a fellow student and colleague) and I interviewed several students.  We hired Nik (software engineer) and Jason (3D modeller and animator).  Our team of 4 UBC students built The LearnCNC project over the next 8 months in our spare time.

The content was originally embedded in a 3D gaming environment and available for free download on Windows.  We did this way back in 2008/09 and since then the gaming engine company has gone defunct.  The [MSI package] (https://sourceforge.net/projects/learn-cnc-game/files/learn-cnc-game/LearnCNCGame_v1.0.0.msi) is still available for download, but no longer works on modern Windows.  If you can get it to work, kudos to you.  You can find all of the source files in the original repo, hosted on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/learn-cnc-game/).  Yes, it's that old.

I've since pulled all the learning content out, coverted Flash Videos to YouTube, and rehosted and deployed here on Github.  Hurray!

If you find the interface super retro-looking and video quality low, remember, it was 2009.  Embrace the nostalgia and enjoy :)
